## Guide to Simply Wall St Exchange Symbols

Unfortunately, the finance industry has not yet agreed upon a consistent standard for exchange and ticker symbols. When we say exchange and ticker symbols an example would be `NYSE:DIS` for Disney or `ASX:CBA` for Commonwealth Bank in Australia.
This list is useful if you want to check exactly which markets are available in Simply Wall St, or if you want to know how to format a spreadsheet for easy importing.

### Examples

Looking at the list below if you wanted to add `Facebook` to your Portfolio the correct exchange and ticker symbol would be `NasdaqGM:FB`, due to it being listed on the Nasdaq Global Markets exchange.
