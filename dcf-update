## Our Automated Intrinsic Value estimates are about to get better

Our automated estimates of intrinsic value provide a quick view of how the company’s financial performance, and analyst estimates, translate to underlying value. Our current calculation works well for stable businesses, but it often doesn’t fully capture the value that fast growing businesses can create. 

So on Saturday the 23rd of February we’re rolling out a few small, but powerful, changes. 

Our new automated intrinsic value estimate will:

Extend the high-growth stage from five years to ten years
Use a new ‘growth curve’ to reach the long-run growth rate
Use an improved ‘adjusted’ historical free cash flow 
### #1: Extended high-growth stage

The 2-Stage Free Cash Flow Model uses two stages. In the first stage, estimates of levered free cash flow to equity are used, which is sourced from market analyst consensus estimates. If no estimates are available, then the last estimate or reported value is extrapolated using the historical average annual growth rate.

In the second stage, a terminal value is calculated using the Gordon Growth formula, with an assumption that the company will continue to grow its earnings at the 10-year government bond rate, forever. The sum of the cash flow arising from the forecasts are then discounted to today's value using a discount rate, then divided by shares on issue, giving a value per share.

With this update we will increase the high-growth stage from five years to ten years. This will better reflect that growing businesses usually continue to grow at a moderate pace, before eventually slowing to the long-run growth rate.

### #2: Use a new growth curve to reach the long-run growth rate

Wherever possible, we use market analyst consensus estimates as the basis of our free cash flow forecasts. If no estimates are available, then the last estimate or reported value is extrapolated using the historical average annual growth rate. The following years are then forecast to grow, but with the growth rate reducing each year, until it reaches the long-run stable growth rate. 



### #3: Adjusted historical free cash flow

When no analyst forecasts are available we will smooth out the latest historical free cash flow numbers. Free cash flow is calculated as:

Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Investments

Capital investments can be lumpy. In some years a new factory is needed, in others it isn’t. To adjust for this our automated intrinsic value estimate will be based on the growth in an adjusted free cash flow result:

Adjusted Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - Three year average rate of Capital Investment



### Which companies will be most affected?

Companies that are growing free cash flow significantly faster than GDP will likely have a higher automated intrinsic value estimate. This is because they will now be forecast to grow for a longer period before reaching the terminal stable growth rate:

Companies that are growing free cash flow at around the same pace as GDP will not see a substantial change from the update: 

Companies with declining free cash flow will likely have a lower automated valuation estimate. This is because the free cash flows will now decline over a longer period before reaching stable growth:

### Ok, cool. Can you show me an example?

Sure!

| 2028 | 111030 | Est @ 5.62% | 35783 |

Present value of next 10 years cash flows: 359949

**Terminal Value**

Terminal Value = FCF2028 × (1 + g) ÷ (Discount Rate – g)
Terminal Value = $111,030 × (1 + 2.73%) ÷ (11.99% – 2.73%)
Terminal value based on the Perpetuity Method where growth (g) = 2.73%: 1231872

Present value of terminal value: 397010

**Equity Value**

Equity Value (Total value) = Present value of next 10 years cash flows + terminal value
Value = Total value / Shares Outstanding  ($756,960.14 / 488.96)


Value per share: 1,548

Current discount (share price of $1,670.43): -7.9%
